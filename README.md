# BitflyerArbitragerBOT
This program is an auto-arbitrage trade for [Bitflyer](https://bitflyer.com/en-jp/), Bitcoin Exchange Point.

Trade target is price gaps between Bitcoin spot trading and futures.

# What's Arbitrage Trade?
Trade method using price gaps of two or + markets with sililar financial instrument.

## Example

Market A 110yen/BTC, Market B 100yen/BTC

If we BUY 1BTC at Market B and SELL 1BTC at Market A, we can earn 110-100=10yen.

This profit is ensured with reason that these two market treat same financial instrument and price will be same after a while.

Spot trading and Futures will be the same price at SQ time, so this fact enables arbitrage trade.

This method said to be low risk and low return (only theoretically, not practically).

# Architecture
## modules
Program modules are made along multiprocessing.

![Architecture](https://github.com/AvocadoWasabi/BitflyerArbitragerBOT/blob/ReadmeImages/images/architecture.png)

## Arbitrage Oppotunity Detail
`(Futures best bid) - (Spot trading best ask) - 2 x (commission) - swap point = expect profit`

If `expect profit > expect_profit_threshold`, the program regards it as an arbitrade oppotunity.

This oppotunity often occures when BTC price goes down rapidly, or when maturity time comes close.

## Boot and Reboot
`config.json` is read when boot and reboot.

Dynamic setting change isn't supported.

## Log output
`yyyymmdd.log` for level-info log.

`yyyymmdd_high_level` for level-warning log for tracing trade log.

## product_code
Product_code is the identifier of each Bitflyer board.

ex. BTC_JPY : spot_trading, BTCJPY24AUG2018: Futures with maturity date(August 24)
